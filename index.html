                <p>
                    I know we don't talk anymore, and maybe that's how it's supposed to be. 
                    But I wanted you to know that the time I spent with you shaped who I am today. 
                    You taught me what it feels like to care deeply about someone, 
                    and I'll always be grateful for that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These sticky notes are my way of letting go and holding on at the same time. 
                    Holding on to the good memories, and letting go of what could never be. 
                    I wish you all the beautiful things in this world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for being my "first love." 💫
