                <p>
                    I know we don't talk anymore, and maybe that's how it's supposed to be. 
                    But I wanted you to know that the time I spent with you shaped who I am today. 
                    You taught me what it feels like to care deeply about someone, 
                    and I'll always be grateful for that.

                    These sticky notes are my way of letting go and holding on at the same time. 
                    Holding on to the good memories, and letting go of what could never be. 
                    I wish you all the beautiful things in this world. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank you for being my "first love." 💫
